# Competition-2015
# Explanation
<ul>
  <li>telnet.py runs on the Yún computer</li>
  <li>Joy_Socket.py runs on the laptop</li>
  <li>Joystick_Yun.ino runs on the mu (edit this as a C++ file)</li>
  <li>Pin-out: PIN5, PIN6, PIN9, PIN10</li>
</ul>

# Running everything
<ol>
  <li>We started each run by shelling into the Yún through PuTTY</li>
  <li>I do not remember the addresses, sadly, but I will try to find them</li>
  <li>telnet.py should start automatically; when it does, the LED will blink in a quick pattern</li>
  <li>You can start the Joy_Socket.py program at this point; it will appear as command line</li>
  <li>All you need to do now is use the joysticks</li>
  <li>Pull the trigger to quit</li>
</ol>

# Why it sucked
<ol>
  <li>telnet.py is probably okay for whatever application we need; I fixed it up a bit</li>
  <li>Joy_Socket.py could probably be improved</li>
  <li>Joystick_Yun.ino is a piece of crap and I spent the least time bettering it</li>
  <li>Also, we probably won't use a Yún so we'll have to write some new code for the motor controls</li>
</ol>
